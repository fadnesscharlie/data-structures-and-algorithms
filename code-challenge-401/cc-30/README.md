# Hash Tables

Hash tables are a way to store data in an array through a linked list. The data is stored at a specific position in an array.

If there are multiple keys with the same position, it will then store the data in the next value to create a linked list.

## Usage

Storing Data in an efficent way that makes it easy to grab the data back in an easy way

## Testing

In our testing, we are testing our methods that we have made. This includes:

- Set Method
- Hash Method
- Get Method is grabbing correct results
- Get Method returns false is key is not in the hash map
- Contains Method:
  - True if key is in hash map
  - False if key is not in the hash map
