# Linked-List-Zip

Here we are creating a zipped linked list, in doing so we want to:

- Grab the values of each list
- Start with List one
  - Then make list two apart of the list
  - Then back to the first, etc

## Challenge

We want to take in two linked list and zip them, meaning combine them but in a zig zag format.

## Approach & Efficiency

Creating a function that takes in two linked list. Creating the head using the first list, then adding the first node in the second list to the main linked list, then back to the first until there is no more nodes left

## API

There is no API's in the making of this challenge
