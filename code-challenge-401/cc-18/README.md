# FizzBuzz

## Challenge

Our challenge today is to traverse through a binary tree and to return a new tree with new values. Through each value, we will see if they are divisible through 3, 5, or both. 

If they are, then instead of returning back the value, we want to return "Fizz" if the value is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the value is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if both, and if not, then we will just return the value.

## Testing

Running `npm run test` will run our test in the root folder checking different nodes if they have changed correctly to Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or returned as a string.
