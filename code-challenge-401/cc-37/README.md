# Graphs

## Usage

Graphs are a way to link multiple nodes to then link thier children or neighbors. When we think of how we can connect to people on social media, a friend of a friend. Graphs are very common in this place because it can link multiple "people" to one user and vice versa.

They also have weight, and edges. Weight is a number you dermine, this can be how linked closely people are, or how far of a distance it is from someone. Edges are the connections from one vertex to another. Vertex meaning simular to node. It can connect to all the other vertexs or just some, or even none.

An example in this challenge will be using the weight to add the cost how much it would be to travel to one place to another. If we want to travel to a place that has a connecting edge, then we can look at the weight to see the cost. But if we want to travel to another place, and it is not connected by an edge, we can not go there. Think of how a plane cant go to every city in the world, but only cities with airports.

## Testing

We will test:
- a graph with one vertex
- with multiple vertexs
- with no data in the vertex
- edges
- weight
- size
