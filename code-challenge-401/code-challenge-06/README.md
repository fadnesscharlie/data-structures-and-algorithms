# Extend Linked List

Here we are creating a linked list, in doing so we want to:

- Insert to the front
- Append to the end
- Insert before a desired node
- Insert after a desired node
- Insert after a node in the middle
- Insert before a node in the middle



## Challenge

We want to test the capabilities of the linked list. As stated above, we had to understand the way a linked list worked and how each node interacted with each other.

## Approach & Efficiency

Using a lot of resources I was able to find out how to create the functions we needed, and with lots of bug testing and errors we found the way.

## API

There is no API's in the making of this challenge
