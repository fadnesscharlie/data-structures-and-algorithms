# k-th value from the end of a linked list

Here we are creating a linked list, in doing so we want to:

- Grab the value of Kth from the end of the linked List
- We also want to check if:
  - Where k that is greater then the list
  - Where k is a positive number


## Challenge

We want to test the capabilities of the linked list. As stated above, we had to understand the way a linked list worked and how each node interacted with each other.

## Approach & Efficiency

Using a lot of resources I was able to find out how to create the functions we needed, and with lots of bug testing and errors we found the way.

## API

There is no API's in the making of this challenge
