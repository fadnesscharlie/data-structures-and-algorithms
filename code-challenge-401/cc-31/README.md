# Repeated Words

In our repeated words functions we made, we are seeing if a word is repeated in a sentence or not.

We want to be able to return back the words that are repeated, and if there are no words, then we want to return back false.

Some usages for this will be to check if are repeating a certain words to much, or to little.

- No duplicates
- If a string is inserted
