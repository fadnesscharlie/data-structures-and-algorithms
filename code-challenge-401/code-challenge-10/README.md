# Stacks and Queues

## Challenge

### Stacks

For stacks we need to create what is simular to an array that we can stack things on.

Stacks work with First in last out and Last in First out.

This makes stacks particular in how you want them to run.

### Queues

Queues are different then stacks, we have a front and rear.

Queues work with First in First out, and Last in Last out.

## Approach & Efficiency

We will create tests for each one.

## API

There is no API's in the making of this challenge

## Tests:

- Can successfully push onto a stack
- Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
- Can successfully pop off the stack
- Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
- Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
- Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
